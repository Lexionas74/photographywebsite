<h1><center>About me</center></h1>

    <p1>The Canon EOS R50 boasts a 24.2 Megapixel APSC Sensor. This fits well into my workflow, as it features a maximum burst rate of 15 photos a second, more then enough for most motorsport scenarios. The R50 features many high end Canon Features such as Dual Pixel Auto Focus and Canon's DIGIC X processor. This greatly helps my workflow, and makes the camera more then quick enough for my needs. The R50 can film uncropped 4K30P video, which is a nice feature when I film video.</p1>

    <br>
    <p1>At the moment, I have yet to purchase any lenses for my cameras, bar the kit lens. While I've gotten some amazing photos out of my kit lens, I still wish to get some more lenses, preferablly a telephoto lens such as the Canon RF 100-400mm f5.6-8 telephoto lensand a newer wide angle lens such as the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 zoom lens.</p1>

    <br>
    <p1>I currently own the K&F concept TM2515M1 tripod. I personally love this tripod, and I'm excited to get lots of use out of this tripod through my motorsport photography at events, and through landscape photos such as Astro Photography or just landscapes in general.</p1>
