    <h1><center>About me</center></h1>
    <center><p>I am a 16 year old photographer based in Melbourne, Australia. I enjoy shooting all kinds of subjects, but specifically motorsports and flora and fauna.</p></center>
    <center><p>While I've technically been doing photography for years, I only realised I truely enjoyed it in 2022, and realised that its something I'd like to do as a hobby. </p></center>
    <center><p>Now, in 2024, I've developed my skills and my passion for photography even further, and I'd love to share some of my work with you! Click the button down below to see some of my photos!</p></center>

    <h2><center>My Gear</center></h2>

    <center><img src="images/image.png" alt="Canon EOS R50" width="250" height="250"></center>
    <p>The Canon EOS R50 boasts a 24.2 Megapixel APSC Sensor. This fits well into my workflow, as it features a maximum burst rate of 15 photos a second, more then enough for most motorsport scenarios. The R50 features many high end Canon Features such as Dual Pixel Auto Focus and Canon's DIGIC X processor. This greatly helps my workflow, and makes the camera more then quick enough for my needs. The R50 can film uncropped 4K30P video, which is a nice feature when I film video.</p>

    <br>

    <br>
    <p>At the moment, I have yet to purchase any lenses for my cameras, bar the kit lens. While I've gotten some amazing photos out of my kit lens, I still wish to get some more lenses, preferablly a telephoto lens such as the Canon RF 100-400mm f5.6-8 telephoto lens and a newer wide angle lens such as the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 zoom lens.</p>

    <br>
    <p>I currently own the K&F concept TM2515M1 tripod. I personally love this tripod, and I'm excited to get lots of use out of this tripod through my motorsport photography at events, and through landscape photos such as Astro Photography or just landscapes in general. I find this tripod to be highly versitle for my needs, and fitting into my workflow perfectly.</p>
    <p>I also own a wide variety of filters for my camera. Some of these include a simple UV filter to protect my lens, but also include a ND filter which helps with getting longer exposures when photograhing in situations with lots of excess light. I also own a set of NEEWER colour filters, which help to add a nice colour tint to my photos!</p>
